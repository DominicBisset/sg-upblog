# Gilbert Sackerman

I am very interested in the artist Gilbert Sackerman, and I'd like to find out more about him. There is not a lot of searchable information about him on the web, so maybe I could find some books one day and gather the stuff that I learn into this post?

## Why Gilbert

Gilbert's art is so architecturally precise. The colours are muted but still beautiful, and the style is generally serene, which is cool because the source matter is so visually hard, or concrete. The buildings keep their sharp edges but they look soft. Architectural art also makes me think of software engineering.

For now, check out these resources:

 * [Idyllic, Depression-Era Watercolors of American Design][1]
 * [Search for Gilbert Sackerman on NGA images][2]
