# Easy API testing without Postman

The big name in API testing is usually [Postman][postman]. It used to be a Chrome extension and now it's standalone, but as a Firefox user I never got into it. A few of my colleagues use it for ad-hoc testing of APIs.
Today I came across a neat web app now operated by the [Runscope][runscope] guys called [hurl.it][hurl], which is a good ad-hoc testing tool if you don't want to download and install a whole thing.

## For example

I was just using some Microsoft Teams webhooks today and I wanted to send a test message to my connector as described in [this post by Stefan Stranger][webhook].
